# Online-Judge-Proxy
Online Judge Proxy is a Command Line Interface that allows students to submit code solutions to Kattis or CodeForces and receive feedback straight on the command line, reducing the need to navigate multiple platforms when preparing for competitive programming competitions.
This project was developed under the guidance of Donald Dong (Meta) along with the support provided by CodeDay Labs.
